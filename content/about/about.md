This workshop has been organized by the *OpenSource Architectures Research Group* at **School of Architecture and Technology from Universidad San Jorge** with the aim to create a network of researchers from different universities and disciplines sharing the same research field: that related to improving disabled peoples' condition in 21st century cities.

Convinced that research has to have some return to society if it has to improve people's lifes, the talks will be open and free to anyone who wants to attend.

We would like to thank Gobierno de Arag√≥n and Universidad San Jorge for funding the event and to all the speakers for their collaboration.
