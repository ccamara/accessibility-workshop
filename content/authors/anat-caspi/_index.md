# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Anat Caspi is Principal Scientist at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. She is Director of the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology, whose mission is to develop, translate and deploy open source universally accessible technologies, with a focus on benefiting individuals with motor limitations or speech impairment. TCAT’s academic mission is to engage undergraduate design and engineering students in participatory design and inclusive design practices. Dr. Caspi’s primary research areas are in the fields of Ubiquitous Computing and Contextually Aware Automation. Her research focuses on engineering machine intelligent solutions for customizable real-time, responsive technologies in the context of work, play and urban street environments. She has designed, developed and evaluated sensor and mobile applications for personalized navigation and routing in pedestrian ways, improving personal automated mobility devices, and enhancing automation in play/work environments with contextually-responsive behavior. Her primary design methods involve participatory design, and a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Dr. Caspi received the Northwest Access Technology Innovation Award in 2017.

Anat Caspi is Director of The Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT). This initiative housed by the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science at University of Washington is focused on translating novel research and technologies for use by populations with disabilities. TCAT also plays a role in continuing the department's well-established engagement with access technologies and in applying universal design practices across a vast array of projects.

Caspi received her PhD in BioEngineering from the Joint Program in BioEngineering at University of California at Berkeley and UC San Francisco and her MS and BS in Computer Science from Stanford University. Her research interests are in the areas of computational biology, ubiquitous computing and bioinformatics. Before returning to academia, Caspi spent a decade in the medical and laboratory devices industry. She brings expertise in translational research and commercialization; with a track record of successful product releases, iterative prototyping and bringing instrumentation to clinical markets. Caspi evaluates and develops new methods/techniques/instrumentation; collaborates in experimental design and execution and coordinates accessible technology projects/functions in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and with other divisions in the School of Engineering. In particular, Caspi is interested in exploring different ways in which collaborative commons and cooperation can challenge and transform the current economics of assistive technology and incentivize rapid development and deployment of access technologies and universally designed technology.
