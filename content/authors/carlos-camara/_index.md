Architect by the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya and Ph.D. on Information and Knowledge Society by the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. I work as teacher and researcher at the School of Architecture and Technology at Universidad San Jorge and I am member of Urban Transformation and Global Change Lab research group at UOC's IN3.

My multiple research interests focus around the commodifications between cities, technology and society within informationalism and free culture frame, as well as the creation of maps as representation and empowering tools, amongst others.
