The Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT), housed by the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science at University of Washington, develops, translates and deploys open source universally accessible technologies, with a focus on benefiting populations with motor limitations or speech impairment.
TCAT's academic mission is to engage undergraduate design and engineering students in participatory design and inclusive design practices.

### Vision

* The Taskar Center for Accessible Technology engages University of Washington students, faculty, and the surrounding community in the creation of a sustainable social enterprise for the development, deployment and support of access technologies.
* TCAT leverages novel tools, sensors, chips, interfaces, open source software and actuators that are inexpensive and readily available to facilitate rapid development and deployment of customized solutions to access problems.
* TCAT focuses on
  * pedestrian access and access to transportation.
  * universal access to collaborative work/play environments
  * computational tools to support community engagement in the creation of access solutions.
