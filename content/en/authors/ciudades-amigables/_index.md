It is a social innovation initiative for the construction of friendly cities for all that seeks to meet social needs not currently catered for by the market or the pub-lic sector, thus opening up a space for public engagement.This publication seeks to share the designed tools and the learning outcomes obtained in order  for  other  organisations  and/or  schools  to  replicate  the  scheme  in  their  own  settings."
