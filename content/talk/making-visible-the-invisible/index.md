title: "Making visible the invisible: Daily experiences of the subject in a situation of physical and sensory disability around the construction of right to the city for developing a mobile app to identify accesible spaces in Ibagué - Tolima"
event: International Workshop on Urban Accessibility

location: Universidad San Jorge, Villanueva de Gállego (Spain)
summary:
abstract: "UNESCO and UN-Hábitat define as 'Inclusive cities' those in which all citizens can exercise their
right to the city, because '(...) the development and equality of all inhabitants are promoted,
without distinction of class, sex, race, ethnicity or religion, in order for them to take advantage as
much as possible of the opportunities that cities offer' (Colin, 2009). So that the city as an ideal
space for human fulfillment that allows weaving material and immaterial relationships, generating
intersubjectivities and (re) producing culture, it is also the appropriate place to exercise the citizen
rights, where people can be, remain and transcend daily, giving the city an emotional and
existential dimension that prints a referent of identity, common values and collective destinies,
giving it a 'sense of place'.
However, the daily experience of citizens regading the physical space shows a continuous
discomfort related to conflicts and vital tensions as spatial segregation and social exclusion of the
population in physical and sensory disability, because of the apparent differences that 'allude to
perceptions, codes and sensibilities shared by us, that separate and marginalize other people, in
order to justify their submission and dependence, denying as Margulis states the right to be
different' (Arenas, Castellanos and Rojas, 2018 ). Therefore, although the right to the city is just
to be able to build and reproduce the city as a non-individual, but a common one, integrating the
views and experiences of all the people who live there; it seems to be denied for all handicapped
people, despite of the recognition that all individuals must have (Robert) 'with an environment
where they can develop their lives as autonomously as possible, enhancing the deployment of their
abilities and reducing as much as possible the limitations, so that appealing to this perspective, an
inappropriate territory becomes a disability factor'(2016).
Now, in order for the right to the city as a possibility, as enjoyment of rights and as participation
(Borda, 2004) can be materialized by handicapped people, the project also look for the use of New
Information Technologies and Communication (NICT) the development of a mobile app supported
by users through the crowdsourcing strategy, allowing them to translate signifiers into Colombian
Sign language LSC and three-dimensional mapping of physical barriers, generating 'forms of
acquisition of geographical data, which lead to the creation and innovation of new computer
products and services aimed at society and public participation in their management, as well as
new strategies and models for the management of geographic information '(Gómez, 2014). So
that, the handicapped population will be able to participate effectively in the prototype designs
from the origin, as well as integrate like potential users in an inclusive technology strategy aimed
at generating their greater autonomy.
According to this, a mixed descriptive study is proposed in order to make a reflexive and critical
analysis of the daily experience of the individual in a situation of physical and sensory disability
around the construction of the right to the city from the description of the experiences of two
population groups: young and adult people with visual, auditory and physical disability, taking as
dimensions or study categories the appropriation of the city and the recognition of inclusion /
exclusion spaces, to finally compare the daily experience of the subject by age groups and type of
disability."
